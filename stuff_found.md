~~1. I see this BOTTOM OVERFLOWED BY 1.00pixels~~ ✅ FIXED - Changed session_length_screen Column to ListView
~~2. the slider in onboarding to select times it should be cyclic not ending~~ ✅ FIXED - Changed to ListWheelChildLoopingListDelegate for infinite scrolling
~~3. when keyboard is active anywhere then tap outside should close the keyboard and also why does the keyboard comes up with all small letters as default shouldnt it be first letter as capital and then switch to small automatically~~ ✅ FIXED - Added GestureDetector to dismiss keyboard + textCapitalization already present

~~4. change the m t w t f s s to three letters in goals~~ ✅ FIXED - Already uses 3-letter names (Mon, Tue, etc.), widened container from 32 to 36px
~~5. Why can i complete task of future date and past date too ?~~ ✅ FIXED - Added date validation to only allow completing today's tasks
~~6. there is something wrong with the brain of the app i just said i am an early bird and added my wake up time for 8am then why did my just created goal's schedule is 6am~~ ✅ FIXED - RuleBasedScheduler now uses DailyActivityService for dynamic wake/sleep times
~~7. If i created a goal today why schedule it before todays~~ ✅ FIXED - Added filter to not schedule goals before their creation date
~~8. There is no option to reschedule the task generated from the goal~~ ✅ FIXED - Added long-press to reschedule with time picker modal
~~9. I deleted my goal but in the ui at some previous date the task for that goal still showing goes away on refresh although it is working just fine for the rest of the dates getting the instant update~~ ✅ FIXED - Goal deletion now deletes scheduled tasks and invalidates timeline cache for ±7 days

~~10. deleting a one time task from timeline by sliding it creates an error the error flashes and disappears~~ ✅ FIXED - Added onDelete callback to OneTimeTaskCard and connected it to UnifiedTimelineCard
~~11. pull down to refresh on timeline page should be removed this feature should not exist was there just to help in development~~ ✅ FIXED - Removed RefreshIndicator from timeline page
~~12. in create task page for one time task it should have the create button at top just like the goals adding page else there is a scrolling and may create friction~~ ✅ FIXED - Added "Create" button to AppBar in add_edit_one_time_task_page
~~13. adding a new one time task from timeline page to a later date doesnot appear in the timeline of that date closing the app and opening again does bring it~~ ✅ FIXED - Converted to ConsumerStatefulWidget and invalidate providers for task's scheduled date
~~14. i think creating tasks for future dates is also a waste we should only do it in the background at 12am everyday and for the futures dates dont give them time just show the names of the tasks that will be there on that date also show the blockers as normal no changes in blockers here~~ ✅ FIXED - Future dates now show goal previews (name + duration + "Preview" badge) without times; one-time tasks still show normally
~~15. reschedule any task coming from goals and then closing the app and coming back into the app resets the reschedule as it creates a new schedule everytime i guess. Need to refine the generating schedule logic what i think is should be 12am midnight and then any time user add one time task/ blockers  or a new goal is added or any goal is deleted even then rescheduled ones shouldnt change for the day~~ ✅ FIXED - Rescheduled tasks (wasRescheduled=true) are now preserved during regeneration; uses incremental updates instead of full regeneration
~~16. Duplicate tasks appearing (2 tasks for each goal on the same date)~~ ✅ FIXED - Added duplicate prevention check before saving tasks in generateScheduleProvider and _generateScheduleIfNeeded; also added cleanup on app startup via removeDuplicateTasks()
